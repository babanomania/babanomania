# Hi, I'm Shouvik

Welcome to my GitHub. I explore ideas, poke complex systems until they blink, and build software that’s useful, secure, and not entirely predictable.

## About Me

- Technical architect. Builder of things. Constant learner.
- Currently spending time on cloud architecture, DevSecOps, real-time data systems, and making LLMs do more than autocomplete buzzwords.
- Deeply interested in UI/UX design — not just how things look, but how they explain themselves, guide users, and recover gracefully when things go wrong.
- I'm drawn to data architecture and streaming for how they shape system behavior, building event-driven flows that stay meaningful as systems scale.
- I focus on event modeling, pipeline evolution, and truthful systems built with Kafka, Flink, lakehouses, and metadata-aware fabrics.
- I work across the stack — designing distributed systems, building LLM-powered tools, deploying containerized applications, and obsessing a bit over observability and feedback loops.

I believe in systems that are simple (but not simplistic), honest (especially about failure), and built with care.

## If You’ve Scrolled This Far...

You’ve reached the end of a README. You’re still here. That’s something.

If you believe software should be honest, data streams should be traceable, alerts should make sense, and LLMs should occasionally crack a joke — let’s talk.

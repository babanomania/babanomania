# Hi, I'm Shouvik

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I explore ideas, break things (sometimes on purpose), and try to build software that's useful, secure, and a little bit different.

## About Me

- Technical architect. Builder of things. Constant learner.
- Currently spending time on cloud architecture, DevSecOps, real-time data systems, and making LLMs do more than autocomplete buzzwords.
- Deeply interested in UI/UX design — not just how things look, but how they explain themselves, guide users, and recover gracefully when things go wrong.
- I work across the stack — designing distributed systems, building LLM-powered tools, deploying containerized applications, and obsessing a bit over observability and feedback loops.

I believe in systems that are simple (but not simplistic), honest (especially about failure), and built with care.

## Skills & Tools

**Architecture & Systems Design**  
- High availability, scalable system design, event-driven architecture, secure SDLC, shift-left security, threat modeling  
- Solution architecture across cloud (OCI, AWS), edge, and serverless platforms  

**DevOps & Infrastructure**  
- Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, CI/CD for multi-cloud and on-prem environments  

**Data & Streaming**  
- Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Kafka Connect, ksqlDB, Airflow  
- CDC pipelines, real-time analytics, observability-driven streaming apps  

**AI & LLM Integration**  
- TinyLlama, Qwen, DeepSeek, Ollama, LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI APIs  
- Fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, agentic workflows, local inference  

**Frontend & Backend Development**  
- React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI  
- Node.js, Fastify, Supabase, Prisma, PostgreSQL, SQLite  

**Monitoring & Observability**  
- OpenTelemetry, Superset, Discord Webhook monitoring, alert engineering, trace-based debugging  

**Security & Privacy**  
- Vaultwarden integration, proof-of-work CAPTCHA design, behavior-driven access control, self-hosted infrastructure  

**Web3 & Blockchain Experiments**  
- Solana, smart contract interaction, token APIs, NFT-based incentive systems  

## If You’ve Scrolled This Far...

You either:

- Have a genuine interest in what I do (hello!),
- Got lost while looking for something else (hi anyway), or
- Are a recruiter using Ctrl+F to search for keywords like "Kubernetes" or "LLM" (don’t worry, I included both).

Either way, I appreciate you making it this far. If you’re into building things that are private by design, observable by default, and slightly chaotic in spirit — we’ll probably get along.

Pull requests welcome. So are unsolicited DMs, as long as they contain memes, merge requests, or mildly philosophical hot takes.

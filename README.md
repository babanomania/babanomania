# 👋 Hi, I'm Shouvik!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! 🚀  
I'm passionate about **building, exploring, and innovating** — whether it's through code, ideas, or learning something new every day.

## 🔥 About Me
- 💻 Tech Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner
- 🌟 Currently exploring **cloud architecture**, **DevSecOps**, **real-time data systems**, and **AI/ML integration**
- 🛠️ Skilled in **Node.js**, **React**, **Kafka**, **Flink**, **Rust**, and **Solana blockchain**
- 🎯 Focused on **building secure, scalable, and impactful software** systems

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 📡 **Designing Real-Time Distributed Systems**  
  Exploring stream processing, ETL pipelines, and event-driven architectures using tools like Kafka, Flink, and Airflow, with an emphasis on fault tolerance, throughput, and horizontal scalability.

- 🧠 **Operationalizing LLMs and Agentic Workflows**  
  Investigating the use of open-source language models (e.g., TinyLlama, Ollama) in domain-specific assistants, integrating reasoning loops, prompt chaining, and retrieval-augmented generation for practical applications.

- 🕸️ **Composable Web Platforms with Edge-First Thinking**  
  Building micro frontends and serverless-first backends, leveraging frameworks like Next.js, Supabase, and TailwindCSS to deliver resilient, clean, and performant web applications.

- 🔐 **Secure-by-Design DevSecOps Practices**  
  Embedding shift-left security concepts, role-based access controls, and CI/CD automation with containerized deployment patterns, especially in multi-cloud and edge environments.

- 🧭 **Enterprise Observability and Telemetry-First Design**  
  Designing systems with baked-in observability using OpenTelemetry and Superset, enabling traceability, real-time alerts, and proactive anomaly detection across the stack.

- 🧩 **UX-Driven System Thinking**  
  Balancing system design with empathetic UX, focusing on feedback loops, accessibility, and minimalist interfaces that reduce cognitive load while increasing user trust.

- ⛓️ **Decentralized Web and Digital Asset Interactions**  
  Experimenting with smart contract interactions, NFT-based incentive systems, and identity primitives on platforms like Solana, within real-world user-facing contexts.
